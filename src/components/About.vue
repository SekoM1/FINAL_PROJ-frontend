       Lyfstyl’s Restaurant started in 2015 as a small family operated bar and dining establishment with two employees. Through several expansions it has evolved into a restaurant that can accommodate up to 100 people. Still family owned, Lyfstyl’s is known for serving friends and families, with quality meals at reasonable prices.
